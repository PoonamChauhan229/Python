Hi Dan (Duy Anh) Nguyen,

Hope you're doing well.
I’m Poonam Chauhan, a MERN Teaching Assistant at BeaconFire, and I’ll be coordinating for MERN technical mock interviews.

You can book your preferred time slots using the calendar link below:

We can begin with Node.js and backend fundamentals, and then move on to React—if you're comfortable with that. Otherwise, we can proceed in the order that works best for you.

Looking forward to your response.

Best regards,
