# Python is very close to English Language

# Python Character Set
# Character Set
# Letters – A to Z, a to z
# Digits – 0 to 9
# Special Symbols - + - * / etc.
# Whitespaces – Blank Space, tab, carriage return, newline, formfeed
# Other characters – Python can process all ASCII and Unicode characters as part of data or literals


# Variables.
# variables by name itself it suggests which can vary by itself
# so the values can be changed at any point of time
# They are also called as identifiers
# Variable names should be simple , short and meaningful
# Variable= value
name = "Poonam"
age=25.4
price=25.99
print(name)
# Wrirtin gour First ever program > Hello World
print("Hello World")
print("Poonam")
# print is an function which helps us to display the final output
print("Poonam is my name","Studying python")
# for a new line different print statements

print(30)
print(20)

print(30+20)

# DataTypes:
# Integers >>+ve,-ve
# String >>"Poonam"
# Float >>3.91 or 3.0
# Boolean >>True or False
# None >>Null
age=23
old=False
a=None
print(age)
print(old)
print(a)

# Reserved  Keywords are those keywords which are not allowed to be used as identifiers

# Reserved keywords are not allowed to be used as function names

# Types of Operators
# An operator is a symbol that performs a certain operation between operands.Apna College
# Arithmetic Operators ( + , - , * , / , % , ** )
# Relational / Comparison Operators ( == , != , > , < , >= , <= )
# Assignment Operators ( = , +=, -= , *= , /= , %= , **= )
# Logical Operators ( not , and , or )
# Types of Operators
# An operator is a symbol that performs a certain operation between operands.

# Type Conversion >>Python interpretor by itslef does its own type conversion
# Implicit conversion
a, b = 1, 2.0
sum = a + b
print(sum)
# float is superoir as compared to int 
p, q = 1, "2"
# sum1 = p + q
# print(sum1)
#error > unsupported operand type(s) for +: 'int' and 'str'


# 2. Explicit Type Conversion (Type Casting)
# Done manually by the programmer using built-in functions.
# Common functions:
# int() → converts to integer
# float() → converts to float
# str() → converts to string
# list() → converts to list
# tuple() → converts to tuple
# set() → converts to set
# Type Casting
# a, b = 1, "2"
# c = int(b)
# sum = a + c

# Input in Python
# input( ) #result for input( ) is always a str
# float ( input( ) ) #float
# give code eg of all 3
# input( ) statement is used to accept values (using keyboard) from user
# input() always gives string

# name = input("Enter your name: ")
# print(name, type(name))   # string

# # Convert input to integer
# age = int(input("Enter your age: "))
# print(age, type(age))     # int

# # Convert input to float
# height = float(input("Enter your height in meters: "))
# print(height, type(height))  # float

# Ques:
# Write a Program to input 2 numbers & print their sum.
# WAP to input side of a square & print its area.
# WAP to input 2 floating point numbers & print their average.
# WAP to input 2 int numbers, a and b.
# Print True if a is greater than or equal to b. If not print False.
